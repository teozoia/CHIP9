# CHIP9 Emu
_Project developped for Advanced Computer Programming exam @ Unimi_


Based on X-MAS CTF 2019 chall, CHIP9 is a 8-bit CPU with 64Kb of main memory (quite similar to Intel 8080 / Z80). CHIP9-Emu is an emulator for the architecture described in the chall specification.

## About challenge
> I found an old CHIP9 console in the attic and a cartridge with a program. Unfortunately the motherboard is gone and the console doesn't turn on anymore. The good news is that I also found the developer's manual, can you understand something more about it?

There are also 3 attachments provided: a PDF with the CPU design specification and 2 compiled program (hex byte): _bootrom_ and _rom_.

## Emulator

The emulator for CHIP9 console is developped with Data Driven Programming, Object Orientation and Generic Programming.
